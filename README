this is an attempt to simulate an ip based access control system in the client side,
two paradigms which actually both fails to hide the private content of the page,
the first one is based on including the ip_based_access_control script inside the content page,
but the content of the page will always get rendered before the script finishes executing,
which means the content will appeare for like a second before redirection,
but the biggest failure is that you can always go back to the previous page,
the second paradigm create an empty index page in which the ip_based_access_control script will be included,
if the user is allowed to view the content he will be redirected to a new page with the content,
otherwise he will be redirected somewhere else, but the downside of this pradigms is that,
everyone can access the content page if he had its URL, there is nothing that protects it
